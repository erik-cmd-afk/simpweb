# Simpweb

Welcome to simpweb, your simple web server tool for Windows, developed by an aspiring 15-year-old developer from Germany! ðŸŒŸ

## About simpweb

simpweb is a lightweight web server specifically designed for Windows. It's inspired by well-known servers like Apache but with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness. This project is still in its early stages, so join us as it grows and evolves! ðŸ’¡

## Features

- Easy to install and use
- Support for static content like HTML, CSS, and images
- Compatibility with Windows environments
- Minimal configuration for a quick start

## Getting Started

### Think about whether you want to 

1. run `simpweb` only in the foreground in the terminal                 `Run in terminal`
2. or with a small detour as a service in the background (recommended)  `Run as service` (comming soon (02.04.2024))
